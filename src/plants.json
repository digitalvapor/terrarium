Now that I'm looking at the plant below the soil (milled peat), it looks like they directly sell cuttings in peat-pucks and drop them in more peat on selling. There was no root structure yet. I went ahead with repotting since I was this far along and gave a mostly sphagnum mix with perlite. I dipped the resuscitated sphagnum in perlite with each handful and then gently packed the plants in larger pots. Hope they survive! I wound up choosing this loose mix based on the Savage Garden's Nepenthes soil section. The other plant at this same arrival date is the other plant in the original pot. Bumped plant ID of other recent plant from NEPEN_16_2 to NEPEN_16_3."
